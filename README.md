# Airbnb Exploratory Analysis (L.A.)

The complete analysis has been uploaded to the following link:

The listing and review datasets used for this project are too large to upload, however available to download via Inside Airbnb (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).

The stop-word list I used has been uploaded for reference.

The exploratory analysis has been developed in three parts:
1. Pre: Listing data cleaning
2. Part I: Description of data
3. Part II: Where to live?  (location analysis)
4. Part III: Which list to select?
-- 1) What kind of hosts can be trusted? (host analysis)
-- 2) What ratings and reviews tell? (review analysis)
